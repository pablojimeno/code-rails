## REFACTOR: Article Authors

We aren't done yet! Check out what happens when we run `$ rake`.

### ERROR:

    undefined method `email' for nil:NilClass

The editing spec doesnâ€™t know the author of the article.

Let's add the author to the fixture, since it's assumed every article has an author. Use the proper user name from your fixtures:

```YAML
cf:
  title: Code Fellows
  body: Means striving for excellence
  author: one

cr:
  title: Code Rails
  body: This is how I learned web development
  author: one
```

Rails knows we mean a `User` when we specify the `author`. Cool, eh?

NOW ... we have ***1 Failure*** and ***1 Error*** (still) because we are testing actions that require user sign-in.

We can add our sign-in snipped to the start of each test (the "edit article" and "delete article" tests):

```ruby
visit new_user_session_path
fill_in "Email", with: users(:one).email
fill_in "Password", with: "password"
click_on "Sign in"
```

Or, better yet. Let's move that snippet into `test_helper.rb`, in a method called `sign_in`. Now, we can replace the 4 lines elsewhere with a simple call to our new method, `sign_in`.

Try it all out in your browser.

How's it look there?
What else can you clean up or refactor?
