# Chapter 11: Polymorphic Comments

Great work! You have comments working in your portfolio.

Rails provides a nice method of allowing one resource to belong to a variety of different other resources. This is exactly how we want to add Comments to a second resource. You can review the brief [slides about polymorphism](http://hijk.it/2y2j3w47331E).

Now it's up to you! Go forth and BDD polymorphic comments.
