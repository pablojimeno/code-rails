## RED Polymorphic

Wouldn't it be great if you could showcase some testimonials from those you worked with on your previous projects? Let's make it so comments can be written on projects (and you'll just approve the positive ones).

Write out the user stories for comments on projects. Authorization can match existing comment policies.

Code up corresponding behavior specs for comments on projects.

Write some fixtures for comments (polymorphic).

- [Active Record Fixtures on APIdock](http://apidock.com/rails/ActiveRecord/Fixtures) (VERY USEFUL!)
