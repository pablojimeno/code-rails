# Tight feedback loops

Leverage the power of iteration.

> You can't steer a ship that's dead in the water.

Keep yourself moving, and as you go make constant course corrections. 
- The sooner you know you are off course, the quicker you can correct
- Spending more time practicing the *right* things will most effectively improve your skills

You will get feedback from:
 - your pair-programming partner as you work out what to type
 - your text editor as you type
 - the Ruby interpreter as you run your code
 - your automated tests
 - what you see in the browser when you try out your code
 - classmates who review your code
 - your grader when you submit assignments
 - your future self, as you review your code

Make the most of all these opportunities to keep learning and focused on the right areas of development.

(One quick and easy thing you can do to help yourself in this area: **Read** your error messages!)
