# Chapter 10: OmniAuth

By now you have the ability to authenticate users.  But we know how much of a pain in is to log in all the time.

Furthermore, the client just called in some additional requirements. "Just a quick thing," they said, "wouldn't it be faster for a commenter to fill in those name & url fields if they could use their Twitter accounts to sign up?"

So... while we're at it, why don't we make it super easy, and let Google, Github, Facebook or Twitter handle the sign in process for us.

Lets set it up.  Start with your tests!!!

Watch Ryan Bates' [RailsCast Episode #235: Devise and Omniauth](http://railscasts.com/episodes/235-devise-and-omniauth-revised?view=asciicast). You don't have to follow along, but it's good practice if you have the time.

It's a revised episode so you should be able to get it running without unexpected problems. After watching, you be familiar with the concepts you'll need to dive into the next section here instead.
