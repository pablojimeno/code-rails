# Chapter 2: Rails Best Practices

Rails is a "best practices" framework. This means there is a "Rails Way" of accomplishing most common web development tasks.

This ends up being very powerful. Once you understand the Rails Way, you can sit down to any rails app that follows best practices and get to work. You don't need to reinvent the wheel, or submit to NIH (Not Invented Here) syndrome. Don't be clever, just go with the community-established style.

This starts with an absolute requirement that everything you do happens under version control. Git has proven to be one of the most powerful and flexible tools for versioning your work, and the Rails community has standardized around it almost entirely. Take your git skills further with the linked resources in the next section.

Then read a chapter of the book *Clean Code* (used with permission). There are a number of much more specific style guides linked as well. Take note of what is new to you, and what you learn.

Then write some code! Use the best practice of BDD to create a new Rails app, and give it a static HTML welcome page. Commit that to a new repo, and submit the repo url for your assignment.

**As you move through the next sections, add each user story to your project management app, and then get to work on implementing them.**
