### Customize the HTML template

If you want to change the `<title>` tag of the HTML page, where would you go?

**Hints** (again, highlight the words below to see them):

- <span style="color: white">
The title tag is something in the page layout, that is set application wide right now.
</span>

- <span style="color: white">
Is it M,V, or C?
</span>


Add some basic information about you to the page. Why would someone want to hire you? What you add doesn't have to be styled well, but try to structure it with basic, semantic HTML.
