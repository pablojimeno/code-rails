# As a Rails developer, I want my code to follow industry-standard best practices so that my projects are readable, scalable, and secure

## Rails conventions:
### Read about READMEs
Take action after reading [this article, written by a Code Fellows alumnus](http://www.stephaniehekker.com/why-you-should-write-a-readme-for-your-application/).

Decide on what **you** want to use as a standard README format for all your projects. Fork Stephanie's template, and modify to own desires, so you have a ready-to-go README to use for your assignments.

### Code for clarity:

- Read [Chapter 1 of Clean Code](https://www.dropbox.com/s/y9jxxvlgnbocvn7/Chapter%201%20-%20Clean%20Code%20-%20A%20Handbook%20of%20Agile%20Software%20Craftsmanship.pdf), by Uncle Bob Martin

- Read [Clarity of code is clarity of thought](http://agile.dzone.com/news/clarity-code-clarity-thought)

- Review this crazy [Clean Code Cheatsheet](http://www.planetgeek.ch/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Clean-Code-V2.2.pdf)

- Optional reading: [My Takeaways from *Clean Code*](https://medium.com/on-coding/a70ca8382884)

### Ruby style guides
- Whitespace
    - 2 spaces (not tabs)
    - No whitespace at the end of the line
    - A single newline at the end of every file
- Comments
    - Read:https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide#comments (just read up to Classes and Methods)
- Online resources:
    - Read: [Batsov's Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide)
    - Read and compare: [GitHub's Sylte Guide](https://github.com/styleguide)
- Gem tool:
    - gem install rubocop
    - Run rubocop from within your project directory for your work from Chapter 1.
    - *Bonus challenge*: figure out how to ignore a warning (like for double-quoted strings, which Brook says is fine)
- Cloud tool:
    - Connect [Hound CI](https://houndci.com) to your repo from yesterday
    - Commit a change, and open a new PR to trigger a code audit
    - Fix up any issues highlighted
- Rails Gemfile:
    - Read: [Gemfile Best Practices](http://mcdowall.info/posts/gemfile-best-practices-and-discourse/)
    - Check out this gem: [Eefgilm](https://github.com/enilsen16/Eefgilm)
    - Also, check out your keyboard shortcuts.
      - e.g., Highlight lines and press`fn + F5` in Sublime Text for Mac

### Your IDE: A text editor

Read how to [remap shift-space to underscore](http://gfxmonk.net/2009/01/29/remap-shiftspace-to-underscore.html).

Then, set up Sublime Text user preferences for our conventions.

Navigate to

    Sublime Text > Preferences > Settings - User

and enter the following preferences:

```javascript
{
    "ignored_packages":
    [
      "Vintage"
    ],
    "save_on_focus_lost": true,
    "tab_size": 2,
    "translate_tabs_to_spaces": true,
    "trim_trailing_white_space_on_save": true,
    "ensure_newline_at_eof_on_save": true
}
```

#### Install the package manager for your version of Sublime.

Install the Sublime package manger. Visit the package manager's webstie, then find and install some of the featured packages.

#### Get to know your editor
