# Paths and Sandboxes

  "A path is a prescribed series of steps that get completed one after another. It's your classic tutorial. A sandbox is a collaborative learning space that values exploration, play, and generating autonomy.  While there are many paths to Rails learning online, it's harder to provide a great example of a sandbox. That is why we are gathered here together in person at this Code Fellows Bootcamp. It's why we don't focus on creating yet another path for you to follow. "
