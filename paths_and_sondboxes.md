# Paths and Sandboxes

A path is a prescribed series of steps that get completed one after another. It's your classic tutorial. A sandbox is a collaborative learning space that values exploration, play, and generating autonomy.  

While there are many paths to Rails learning online, it's harder to provide a great example of a sandbox. That is why we are gathered here together in person at this Code Fellows course. It's why we don't focus on creating yet another "path" for you to follow.

Path learning certainly has utility. You will be pointed to some of our favorite pathy resources. 

But the majority of your work and effort will be spent in the sandbox. You will be asked to generate the answer, create your own solution, or pick your own way forward. This can feel scary or vulnerable, but please trust that feeling to lead you in to deeper practiceâ€”and more effective skill acquisition.
