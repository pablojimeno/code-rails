### ERROR:

    SQLite3::SQLException: table users has no column named role...

Every test breaks, because our fixtures cannot load without a role column on user. Add a migration. Users should have a 'role' attribute. Just a string will do for now.

    $ rails generate migration add_role_to_users role

Check out that generated file. Does it look like it will set things up the way you want? Any suspicious typos, keywords, or syntax?

Run the migration, and ensure your test db is reflecting the schema change.
