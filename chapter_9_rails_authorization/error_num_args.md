### ERROR:

    wrong number of arguments (1 for 0)

Do you see this same error?

Our `sign_in` method in `test_helper.rb` doesn't have an argument for *who* to *sign in*. Modify it to accommodate, with a default to editor, so current tests still work:

```ruby
def sign_in(role = :editor)
  visit new_user_session_path
  fill_in "Email", with: users(role).email
  fill_in "Password", with: "password"
  click_on "Sign in"
end
```
