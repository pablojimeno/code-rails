# Do you need a Ruby Version Manager?
Developers often use a "ruby version manager" so they can run multiple projects in parallel that require different versions of Ruby.

If you know you'll require different versions of Ruby, then you can install the version manager of your choice. These days `chruby` is quite popular, but `rbenv` and `rmv` get the job done as well. 

If you don't yet have a reason to keep different versions of Ruby on your system, defer the setup on this for now, and just use `brew install ruby` to get a good, recent version.
