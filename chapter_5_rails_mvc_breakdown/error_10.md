### Error:

```
AbstractController::ActionNotFound: The action 'create' could not be found for ProjectsController
```

More progress! Capybara is now trying to submit our form data to the create action! Therefore... What do we need next?

You should know the drill by now, add that action in the controller! But this time, the method is going to need to be a bit different:

```ruby
def create
  @project = Project.new(params[:project])
  if @project.save
    flash[:notice] = "Project has been created."
    redirect_to @project
  else
    # we'll get to this in a bit
  end
end
```

Can you follow that enough to understand what it is doing?

What kind of value does `@project.save?` return?
