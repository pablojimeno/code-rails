## GREEN: Code and run the spec often!

Keep running the spec and resolving errors until it works! Remember, you can run just this one test with the following command from our project root:

    $ ruby -Itest test/features/projects/editing_a_project_test.rb

The `-Itest` is a bash option for the ruby command, as seen when you run:

    $ ruby --help


What's the output of your test?
