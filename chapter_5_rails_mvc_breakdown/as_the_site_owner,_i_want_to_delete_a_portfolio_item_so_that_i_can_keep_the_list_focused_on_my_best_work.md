# As the site owner, I want to delete a portfolio item so that I can keep the list focused on my best work


### RED, GREEN, REFACTOR (again)!

Ready for the sandbox? Use what you've learned to BDD/TDD this out:

- Write spec for deleting a portfolio item.

- Run the specs often and add code to get beyond each error message.

- Add the behaviors to the app to get that spec passing!

##### Hints:

<span style="color: white;">
  Adding a **Destroy** link to the show view may be easier than deleting from the index view.

<span style="color: white;">
  The scaffold code generated for Articles may be useful as a reference.
