# How to Learn: Edge Practice

Kathy Sierra summarizes much of the recent science of learning in a talk she gave at a conference. You can (optionally) read a [Summary of her presentation](http://justingoeres.tumblr.com/post/32669772969/live-from-bos2012-building-a-minimum-badass-user).

She is talking about building great products (web apps), to most effectively help users. For you, as a learner, many of the same lessons apply when working on rapid skill acquisition. 

Highlights:
- Practice makes <s>perfect</s> **permanent**. Ensure you practice the correct thing.
- If you want to be a badass, maximize repeated exposure to the performance, process, and results of badass examples (models).
- Edge Practice: practicing the same thing over and over doesn't make you great. Practice at the edge of your abilities to stretch them to new heights.
- Edge / deliberate practice is NOT the same as tutorials. Find a way to get high-quality, low-latency feedback. Example: make it easy to keep re-running a failed test of your code, until you know when it passes.
