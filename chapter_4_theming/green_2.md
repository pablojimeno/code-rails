Add the theme's files to the appropriate places in the Rails file hierarchy.

Keep referencing the [The Rails Asset Pipeline Guide] (http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html), as needed - especially Section 2.1.

Remember, "assets" are the CSS, JS, font, and image files that your pages use.

The theme you selected should simply have HTML/CSS/JS/fonts/images that you need to pluck from the theme and add to your Rails app. Copy/paste is ok here (it's third-party software)!

Some things belong in `app/assets` and others in `vendor/assets` - what is the difference?
