# Project Management

### As a developer, I want to use a Project Management App so that I can create and time tasks

## User Stories

As programmers, we like to think about how users will interact with our app.  Do do this, we write down the features and the reasons why they would use them in a short format.  We call these sentences "User Stories"

Generally, a good user story comes in the form "As a 'user type', I want to 'do something', so that the user can..."

Example: "As an Attorney, I want to note down that my client called, so that other Attorneys on the case will know we spoke"

## Project Management Apps:

As developers, we need a way to track out user stories (what we need our app to do).  There are a variety of different online tools to help us.  All of these tools are pretty helpful, and will give you a good way to track your user stories during your app development.
