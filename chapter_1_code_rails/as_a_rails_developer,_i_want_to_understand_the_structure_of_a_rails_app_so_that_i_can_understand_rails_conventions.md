# Rails

### As a Rails developer, I want to understand the structure of a Rails app so that I can understand Rails conventions

WTF just happened when I ran `$ rails new` ???

You have a fresh new Rails app, which by default says "Welcome Aboard"

**Read** only Section 3.2 of the ["Getting Started" Rails Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#creating-the-blog-application)

**What is Rails?**

- a Ruby framework

  >Rails is actually a collection of 7 different ruby gems that are designed to function independently or together, to form a framework for web apps.
- Utilizes Convention over Configuration
  - [Read more about convention over configuration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration)
  - Optional bonus reading: [Why universal remotes suck](http://softwareengineering.vazexqi.com/files/pattern.html)
- open source, built around community best practices
- Remember our slides:
  - Web app vs Web site
  - Can persist user data in a database
  - Dynamically creates html/css/js content for each user request
