# BDD

## As a developer, I want to use and understand BDD so that my projects turn out great

Ready to start using BDD? We are going to do it in 4 steps. Each step has it's own user story.

1. Test: app has welcome message
 As a dev, I want a simple program that has a welcome message, so that I learn how to write and test a simple ruby project

1. Test: Search the Web
  As a dev, I want a program to test a web search, so that I can learn more about interacting with web pages

1. Test: app has HTML Welcome
  As a dev, I want a web page that outputs a welcome message via HTML, so that I can learn how to test web pages

1. Test: app runs at localhost:3000
  As a dev, I want a basic Rails app up and running on port 3000 of my computer

Code up the spec, then get it passing (BDD style).

### Ready?
### Set!
### Go!!!!!!
