    ### Write a User Story

Start with Given / When / Then (GWT) comments:

```ruby
scenario "new project has invalid data" do
  # Given invalid project data is entered in a form
  # When the form is submitted with a short name and missing technologies_used field
  # Then the form should be displayed again, with an error message
end
```

How would you flesh that out?

What does invalid data look like?

Perhaps both fields should have a minimum length?
