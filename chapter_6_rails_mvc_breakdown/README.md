# Chapter 6: Rails MVC Breakdown

## Intro: MVC

  The time has come. We will build out the MVC structure of a Rails resource from scratch, without help from the scaffold generator. You should already have a good sense of what a resource is, and what you can do with a resource in your app. Now it's time to see how it all happens! Let's pull back the curtain on the scaffold generator, and see what Rails is really all about.

  In this chapter, you'll initially see a step-by-step way to create a behavior spec, and let it "drive" your development. From error to error, following the bouncing ball, you can feed Rails just enough to hush the complaint, and see what pops up next.

  Then, once you've gotten used to that flow, you can try it on your own, with less step-by-step and more independent thinking and careful reading of errors (a key skill to learn at this point)!
