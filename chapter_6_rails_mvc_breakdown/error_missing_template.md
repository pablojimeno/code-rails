### Error: Missing Template

    Error: ActionView::MissingTemplate: Missing template projects/create, application/create with {:locale=>[:en], :formats=>[:html], :handlers=>[:erb, :builder, :raw, :ruby, :jbuilder, :coffee]}.

Good progress. Now, rather than moving right through to the `show` action, it is staying in the `create` action.

Since the save (in `ProjectsController#create`) fails, the `else` block that we left blank earlier is executed.

Since there is no `redirect` or `render` statement, Rails searches our `views` folder, and looks for a `create.html.erb` template to match the action name - that's a Rails convention.

We don't really want to do this. We want to show the same `new` page with the "New Project" form on it, but now with the error messages we picked up from the failed save.

So let's add some logic to the `else` block when our save fails.

For starters, let's just add a `render` statement to render the existing `new` view. Your `create` action should now look like this:

```ruby
def create
  @project = Project.new(project_params)
  if @project.save
    flash[:notice] = "Project has been created."
    redirect_to @project
  else
    render :new
  end
end
```

See the change?
