# 6.1 Pre-requisite Reading

Rails uses Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) through Active Record to acces data in the database (e.g. SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL).

Read the [Active Record Basics](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html) guide to get familiar with how it works.

If you haven't already, please really read [**Chapter 3:** *REST, Resources, and Rails*](http://assets.codefellows.org/tr4w_chapter_3.pdf), from *The Rails 4 Way*, by Obie Fernandez.

We recommend that you purchase this book because it's a great reference book that you will use after the course also.

The The Rails 4 Way (3rd Edition) is available on [InformIT](http://www.informit.com/store/rails-4-way-9780321944276) and [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321944275/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321944275&linkCode=as2&tag=codrai-20&linkId=MTW5LINTXI4B27NO). You can also find (quite good) beta access to the book with a little resourcefulness.
