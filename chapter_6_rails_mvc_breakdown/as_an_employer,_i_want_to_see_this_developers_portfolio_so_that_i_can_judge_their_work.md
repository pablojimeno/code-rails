# As an employer, I want to see this developer's portfolio so that I can judge their work

A portfolio is a list of many portolio items (or pieces, projects, etc. you can call them what you want). This is another simple Rails resource, but we are not going to use the scaffold.

Work through through the next sub-sections to BDD/TDD it out.
