## REFACTOR:
Check your coding style and clarity. Anything you need to clean up?

It looks like the `show`, `edit`, and `update` actions all set up the `@project` instance variable in the exact same way. That is repetition.

Let's DRY that up:

  1. Create a new private method called `set_project`.

  - The contents of that method should be the code that is repeated in the `show`/`edit`/`update` actions that sets up the instance variable.

  - Replace the code in those actions with a simple call to this new method.

  - Better yet, find a way to call the `set_project` method before each of those actions that need it, so you don't even have to repeat the method call.

  - After you've tried it on your own, take a look at your `ArticlesController` to see how it is done when generating your application code with the scaffold.
