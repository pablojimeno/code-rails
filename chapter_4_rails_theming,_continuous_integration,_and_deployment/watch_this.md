# Watch This!

Watch Ryan Bates demonstrate the use of Fundation in this RailsCast: [Episiode #417 - Foundation](ttp://railscasts.com/episodes/417-foundation?view=asciicast).

Work along with the video to make a new Rails app.

When the RailsCast suggests changing CSS values, put in your own values to see the change and use something that you like.

This RailsCast is done with Rails 3.2. When you create your app you're going to want to make sure to use the same version of rails.

    $ gem install rails -v 3.2.13

    $ rails _3.2.13_ new [appname]


If you really get stuck, clone the finished app from
GitHub, and just follow along closely with the code.

Use the latest version of Rails, and try to figure out what is different.

If you get stuck, use this example Foundation app by "RailsApps" as a reference:
https://github.com/RailsApps/rails-foundation.

**Push your new app to GitHub.**
