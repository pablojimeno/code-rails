# Watch This!

Watch Ryan Bates demonstrate the use of Fundation in this RailsCast: [Episiode #417 - Foundation](ttp://railscasts.com/episodes/417-foundation?view=asciicast).

Work along with the video to make a new Rails app.

Where the RailsCast suggests changing CSS values, put in your own values to see the change and use something that you like.

This RailsCast is done with Rails 3.2. If you want to follow along from scratch, create your app with the same version of rails:

    $ gem install rails -v 3.2.13

    $ rails _3.2.13_ new [appname]


If you really get stuck, clone the finished app from
the episode's GitHub repo, and just read along closely with the code.

If you are really up for a challenge, follow along using the latest version of Rails, and try to figure out what is different.

If you get stuck, use this example Foundation app by "RailsApps" as a reference:
https://github.com/RailsApps/rails-foundation.

**Push your version of the app to GitHub, with your own README.**
