# As a developer, I want to integrate a theme, so that my site doesn't look like all the other "bootstrap-y" sites out there

## Design Your Own

The RailsCast is essentially building up a custom theme. If you like that approach, and have the CSS chops already, keep going with it to make your site look the way you want it.

If you don't feel comfortable spending your time on a custom design for your website, below are some collections of Zurb themes.

Foundation 5 is the latest version of Foundation, and you should be using that version.  Look for Foundation 5 templates, so it matches your Foundation version number. ***DO NOT*** use a theme unless it states that is based on the same version number - you will waste valuable time if you ignore this warning.  Avoid the Joomla, Drupal, and Wordpress options - you want plain ol' HTML5 + CSS3. Some cost money ($5 to $50), some are free. Paying for a professionally designed theme is a great time saver.

The simpler the theme is that you select, the easier time you will have integrating it into your site.
