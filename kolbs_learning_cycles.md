# Kolb's learning cycles
##### David Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle

David Kolb identified four stages in the adult education process that must all be performed to achieve true understanding:

* Concrete Experience &rarr;
* Reflective Observation &rarr;
* Abstract Conceptualization &rarr;
* Active Experimentation &rarr;

Each stage is mutually supportive of and feeds into the next. It is possible to enter the cycle at any stage and follow it through around the circle."

Please read [this article](http://www.simplypsychology.org/learning-kolb.html) that summarizes the different learning styles that result from these phases of education. Which learning style do you feel most drawn towards?
