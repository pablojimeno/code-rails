# Kolb's learning cycles
##### David Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle

David Kolb identified four stages in the adult education process:

* Concrete Experience &rarr;
* Reflective Observation &rarr;
* Abstract Conceptualization &rarr;
* Active Experimentation &rarr;

True mastery of a skill or concept requires time spent in each stage.


Each stage is mutually supportive of and feeds into the next. It is possible to enter the cycle at any stage and follow it through around the circle."

Please read [this article](http://www.simplypsychology.org/learning-kolb.html) that summarizes the different learning styles resulting from these phases of education. Which learning style do you feel most drawn towards?
