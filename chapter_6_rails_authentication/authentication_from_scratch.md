# Authentication From Scratch

Watch, learn, and follow along with [RailsCast Episode #250: Authentication from Scratch](http://railscasts.com/episodes/250-authentication-from-scratch-revised?view=asciicast). You'll have to sign up for a Pro RailsCasts subscription to access this episode.


The RailsCast uses Rails v3.2.1, so you have ***two options***:

1. Install and use Rails v3.2.1, try to match all gem versions exactly (refer to GitHub repo)

- **Recommended**: Use the latest patch-level version of Rails 3, which has some small differences.


Use underscores to create the app with your desired version:

    $ rails _3.2.21_ new auth

Rails 3.2.11+ will require and add the `attr_accessible` line for you when a model is generated, so pay attention to what's happening in your model.

If you need an extra reference, there is [an example repo](https://github.com/codefellows/auth) of creating auth from scratch (uses Rails 3.2.14), on the [Code Fellows GitHub account](https://github.com/codefellows).

Do not directly duplicate, clone, or copy & paste that repo!
