# Read about scaffolding!

To get you in the right mindset, and provide a little bit of context, here's some background material you should spend some time with before proceeding.

### First, read the Rails Guide

Read our modified copy of [Sections 5 through 6 Rails Getting Started Guide](http://assets.codefellows.org/getting_started_rails_modified.html), but don't work along with the article... yet.

Not very BDD, is it? Try not to skip over the contents of the table showing files generated.

### Then, read this blog post

Read this [Code Fellows Alumnus' Blog Post](http://strandcode.com/2013/07/28/reading-rails-mvc-and-scaffolding-for-rails-newbs).

This is a greatly detailed article that lays out exactly what Rails is doing for you when you use a generator.

Don't ya love the intro to this article, that captures the feeling of learning Rails?
