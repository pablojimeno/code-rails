# Watch and learn about Minitest!

Get out the popcorn, it's movie time!


### Minitest Insights with Ryan Davis

Watch an overview of minitest in [Minitest Insights with Ryan Davis](http://vimeo.com/75833835), starring Ryan Davis, the creator of Minitest.

### RailsCast on MiniTest with Rails

This one is *optional*.

Keep these things in mind as you watch the video below. The video is pretty old. It uses outdated versions of Rails and Minitest. Don't try to code along with it, just sit back and enjoy - try to get a sense of the general concepts being presented. Don't pay too much attention to how Ryan sets up Minitest, but watch more generally how he creates a Rails app, and uses a few different kinds of testing. There are a few good hints towards the end.

Go watch the RailsCast on [MiniTest with Rails](http://railscasts.com/episodes/327-minitest-with-rails?view=asciicast) (16 min.).

Now, let's give it a try!
