Get out the popcorn, it's movie time!

  1. Ryan Davis, the creator of Minitest, gives an overview: http://vimeo.com/75833835
  1. Optional: RailsCast on [MiniTest with Rails](http://railscasts.com/episodes/327-minitest-with-rails?view=asciicast) (16m).
      - Note: This video is pretty old.
      - It uses outdated versions of Rails and Minitest.
      - Don't try to code along with it, just sit back and enjoy.
      - Don't pay too much attention to how Ryan sets up Minitest, but watch more generally how he creates a Rails app, and uses a few different kinds of testing.
      - There are a few good hints towards the end.

Ok, let's give it a try!
