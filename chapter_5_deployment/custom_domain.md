# Your very own domain

Now it is time to set up your very own custom domain.

Your personal portfolio domain name should be:

* Appropriate for work (potential employers)

* Memorable (don't make it difficult for people to find you)

* Easy to say and spell over the phone (Say it out loud a few times and try to tell it to other people.)

# Spec it out

Add an additional spec that is a modification of the day 1 `welcome_page_spec`, but checks instead against your public domain name.

This will essentially be a ping test to ensure your app is up and running in production.
