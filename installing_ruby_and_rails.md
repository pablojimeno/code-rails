# 0.3 Install Ruby and Rails

## System setup goals:
  - Install the latest version of Ruby
  - Ruby should be installed in userspace, not at the system level. If you are using `sudo` to install gems, then "you're doing it wrong", as they say.
  - Use your system's package manager to install as much stuff as possible
  - Install the latest version of Rails

To get you going, follow along with the installation instructions matching your system. You can skip the instructions for other systems.
