# Best practices

Rails is a web app framework that is influenced by best practices at its very core.

>"A best practice is a method or technique that has consistently shown results superior to those achieved with other means, and that is used as a benchmark" - [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_practice)

Rails was originally built as a web app, Basecamp. David Heinemeier Hansson recognized that much of what was created for Basecamp was applicable to web apps in general. Rails was extracted, then open-sourced. Development on Rails continues to take out the "boring parts" of web app creation, allows efficient building of new web apps if you stick to "the Rails way".
