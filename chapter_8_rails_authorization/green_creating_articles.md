## GREEN: Creating Articles

As always, we'll start by seeing how those tests fail, and then we'll proceed to write *just enough* code to get us to the next failure or error message. Develop your new feature, working through each error that you encounter.

To make iterating a little faster, re-run __only__ those article creation tests after every error you correct:

    $ ruby -Itest test/features/articles/creating_an_article_test.rb
