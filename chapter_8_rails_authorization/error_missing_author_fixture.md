### ERROR:

    No fixture named 'author' found for fixture set 'users'

I bet you know what to do here. You should add a new fixture for `:author` and one for `:editor`.

Try it yourself first. How might we determine what role each user record belongs to?

What, you want to see an example? Wait, did you try it yourself, first?

OK, here's the example:

```YAML
author:
  email: author@example.com
  encrypted_password: <%= User.new.send(:password_digest, 'password') %>
  role: author

editor:
  email: editor@example.com
  encrypted_password: <%= User.new.send(:password_digest, 'password') %>
  role: editor
```
