# Chapter 8: Rails Authorization

Use BDD to build ***authorization*** roles for your Portfolio application.

We're going to add the ability to mark blog articles as "published" - and we will specify who can publish articles.

To manage this, we will create three roles on your portfolio site:

1. **Editors**: these are the site admins that can do everything, including marking articles as "published"

- **Authors**: these can write articles, but not publish them.

- **Visitors**: the default user type, a regular site visitor, they can only view published articles.

Ready to give it a go?

**Your assignment**: Modify your portfolio to have the above behaviors.

Write a whole bunch of user stories for all these behaviors. Add these to your PM tool:

#### Authors

1. As an author, I want to only see my own articles so that I can focus on my work.

- As an author, I want to create articles so that I can share great content with the world.

- As an author, I want to update articles so that I can fix typos.

- As an author I should not be able to publish articles so that I can give the editor publishing control, and I should see a 'not authorized' message if I try to hack it.

- As an author I should not be able to delete articles so that I can give the editor publishing control.


#### Editors

1. As an editor I want to see all articles regardless of published status in the blog index so that I can choose which articles to publish

- As an editor I want to create articles so that I can share great content with the world

- As an editor I want to update articles so that I can fix typos

- As an editor I want to publish articles so that I can make articles live on the site

- As an editor I want to delete articles so that I can remove opium-fueled Jabberwocky


#### Visitors (unauthenticated users)

1. As a site visitor, (user) I want to read (view) articles so that I can enjoy quality content

- As a site visitor, I should not be able to delete, update or create articles so that I can't modify a site I don't own.

- As a site visitor, I want to only see published articles so that I don't see crap drafts.
